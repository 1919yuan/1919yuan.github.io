      <description>The example repository is located at https://github.com/1919yuan/nuxt-firebase-example
 I&amp;rsquo;ve been volunteering in an NPO and learning webapp development recently. After procrastinating for a long time, I finally settled down on using Nuxt.js for developing the website for the NPO. Even though there are many resources on nuxtjs.org about deploying to different environments, there is not an official guide about deploying an universal mode Nuxt.js application to Firebase. This becomes more difficult when you want to leverage Firebase&amp;rsquo;s authentication and firestore service in universal mode.</description>
