      <description>I graduated from University of Science and Technology of China in 2008, and then went to U.S. for graudate study. USTC has always held a special place in my heart. Here are some letter templates that I prepared during my graduate school application, and I hope they would still be useful to my fellow USTCers who are preparing to apply for graduate schools.
Watermarked letter template in doc,latex formats
USTCers please feel free to contact me at 1919yuan at gmail dot com anytime &amp;ndash; I enjoyed my days at USTC so much, and I would like to do all I can to help make USTC a better place.</description>
